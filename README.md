# KeyLogger

A Python-based KeyLogger that captures and records all keyboard inputs in real-time and stores them in a text file for further analysis. This tool can be used for educational purposes, monitoring authorized devices, and understanding how key events are handled in Python.

## 🚀 Features

- Logs every keystroke made on the system keyboard  
- Outputs captured keystrokes to a `key_log.txt` file  
- Lightweight and easy to deploy  
- Works on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux)  
- Runs in the background silently  

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system  
- Required Python libraries: `pynput`  `json` 

## ⚡ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sivarajesh17/KeyLogger.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd KeyLogger
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🎯 Usage

1. Run the keylogger script:

    ```bash
    python keylogger.py
    ```

2. The keystrokes will be logged in real-time and saved to `key_log.txt` located in the same directory as the script.
